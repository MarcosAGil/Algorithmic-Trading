# Market Making Algorithm Project

This project implements a Market Making algorithm that analyzes market data to simulate and improve trading strategies.

## Project Description

The Market Making algorithm focuses on the bid and ask prices, optimizing the spread to facilitate profitable trades. Using historical RFQ (Request for Quote) and mid-price data, this project analyzes market trends and employs strategies to predict optimal points for order placement.

## Requirements

- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (Miniconda or Anaconda)
- Python 3.x

## File Structure

- `Market_Making_Algoi.pynb`: Jupyter notebook with the code and main analysis for the Market Making algorithm.
- `rfqs.csv`: Dataset with historical RFQ data.
- `mids.csv`: Dataset with historical mid-price data.
- `environment.yml`: Conda environment file for installing all necessary dependencies.
