# Execution Algorithm Project: Volume and Price Analysis

This project implements a market order execution algorithm focused on analyzing volume and price to simulate non-interactive trading strategies.

## Project Description

The project is designed to analyze historical volume and price data and use it in an order execution model. It employs Python tools to visualize and analyze the data, as well as to implement prediction techniques within the context of algorithmic trading.

## Requirements

- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (Miniconda or Anaconda)
- Python 3.x

## File Structure

- `Execution_Algor_NoInteractGraphs.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the main code and analysis of the project, from data loading to result visualization.
- `volume_price_2014_18.csv`: Historical volume and price dataset from 2014 to 2018, used to train and test the execution model.
- `environment.yml`: Conda environment file to install all necessary dependencies.
